# 📮 2. Dropshipping - direct to customer

You run your store, we handle the packing and shipping for you! 💯

### 🤔 How it works

1. We agree in advance the SKUs that we’ll hold on your behalf, and how those are to be fulfilled
2. You send us the inventory which we’ll store on your behalf - make sure you keep your own inventory tracking so you don’t oversell!
3. You’ll send us a weekly file that meets our specifications and we’ll use that to ship your items - easy!
4. If you’ve asked for it, we’ll send you shipping data with tracking numbers by return
