# üõç Stock with us

If you'd like us to stock your books, games, zines, or any other form of physical media then shoot us an email to store@peregrinecoast.press and include the following:

* The name of your item
* Brief description of what it's about - no need to send an essay,  a quick pitch is more than enough
* Dimensions: size and weight help us figure out if we've got the space for it
* Its [wholesale](../fulfilment/glossary.md) price
* Its [retail](../fulfilment/glossary.md) price
* A digital copy we can have a look through, if possible

It'd be ace if you've got a Press Kit that you could send over, but don't worry about it if you're a hobbyist or just starting out and don't have one. The most useful things to feature in a Press Kit for us:

* Photos of your item (or some nice renders, if you don't have photo chops)
* Product description and tagline

### Striking a deal

We're still pretty small so we usually take 5-10 copies of an item so that we can test out how well it sells. Honestly, we're still pretty dependent on creators driving traffic to _us,_ so we might ask that you link our shop somewhere on your product page so folks know they can get physical copies on our store.&#x20;
