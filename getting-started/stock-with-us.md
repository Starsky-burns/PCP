# üõçÔ∏è Stock with Peregrine Coast Press

If you'd like us to stock your books, games, zines, or any other form of physical media then shoot me an email to store@peregrinecoast.press and include the following:

* The name of your item
* Brief description of what it's about - no need to send an essay, a quick pitch is more than enough
* Dimensions: size and weight help us figure out if we've got the space for it
* Its [wholesale](../fulfilment/glossary.md) price
* Its [retail](../fulfilment/glossary.md) price
* A digital copy we can have a look through, if possible

It'd be ace if you've got a Press Kit that you could send over, but don't worry about it if you're a hobbyist or just starting out and don't have one. The most useful things to feature in a Press Kit for me:

* Photos of your item (or some nice renders, if you don't have photo chops)
* Product description and tagline

### Striking a deal

PCP is still pretty small so I'll usually take 5-10 copies of an item so that I can test out how well it sells. Honestly, I'm still pretty dependent on creators driving traffic to _us,_ so I might ask that you link to the PCP shop somewhere on your product page so folks know they can get physical copies from me.
