# ðŸ’¸ The Creator Fund

To support creators from marginalised and poor backgrounds, we pledge to set aside Â£1 from every purchase on our store towards our Creator Fund.

Once we've built up at least Â£100, we'll open up applications for the Creator Fund. The successful applicant will get a physical print run handled and paid for by us, with the rest of the money going straight to them as a no strings attached grant they can use to pay for their costs.

We will also put the project up for sale on the Peregrine Coast Press shop according to our regular wholesale terms of 50%.
