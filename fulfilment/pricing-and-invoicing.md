## Fulfillment

We'll pick, pack and ship your orders on your behalf. The single price includes all materials and shipping charges. We charge flat fees across the EU and internationally to make it easier for you to charge your customers the right price.

**How the weight bands work**

Each band includes one SKU up to (not including) the next band. It just applies to the weight of your items - I'll handle the packaging.

Additional SKUs are charged at a flat Â£1.20 per additional pick.

### EU DDP

We are able to offer DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) on shipping.&#x20;

We charge a flat **25% of declared value** to cover the import tax & duties of your zines, and our additional administration costs associated with doing so.

Note that this is a **fixed** fee and doesn't vary based on local taxes or the goods you're sending. This allows you to charge your backers a single percentage of tax for the regions we support DDP to.

_**What is DDP?**_

Usually we deliver items without customs charges or duty paid. The recipient receives notification from the postal service and pays the levied charges and an administration fee. With DDP, we pay any charges on your behalf before the border so your zines are delivered quicker, more reliably and without the recipient having to take any action.

## Bundling and Assembly

We don't routinely do assembly, however we do consider requests to help people out.

Assembly is taking multiple items (eg. multiple zines, player sheets, stickers etc.) and combining them into a single pack to be sold as a combined SKU.

Please [contact us](mailto:fulfilment@peregrinecoast.press) if you think you might need this!
