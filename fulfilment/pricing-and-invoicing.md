### EU DDP 

We are able to offer DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) on both tracked and untracked orders to the
following EU countries: 

- Germany
- France
- The Republic of Ireland
- Portugal
- The Netherlands
- Cyprus 
- Malta
- Austria

We charge a flat **20% of declared value** to cover the import tax & duties of your zines, 
and our additional administration costs associated with doing so. 

Note that this is a **fixed** fee and doesn't vary based on local taxes or the goods 
you're sending. This allows you to charge your backers a single percentage of tax for the 
regions we support DDP to. 

_**What is DDP?**_

Usually we deliver items without customs charges or duty paid. The recipient receives notification
from the postal service and pays the levied charges and an administration fee. With DDP, we pay
any charges on your behalf before the border so your zines are delivered quicker, more reliably 
and without the recipient having to take any action.
