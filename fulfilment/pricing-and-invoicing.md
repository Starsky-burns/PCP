# 💰 Pricing & Invoicing

## Fulfillment  

We'll pick, pack and ship your orders on your behalf. The single price includes all materials
and shipping charges. We charge flat fees across the EU and internationally to make it easier
for you to charge your customers the right price. 

**How the categories work** 

Category A is a single SKU (zine or bundle) up to 200g. Additional items can be added for 
a fixed price. 

Category B and C include multiple SKUs up to the weight limit. 

_Note_ that we don't routinely do assembly of bundles (see below) so B & C are only for 
the inclusion of multiple SKUs, and you'll need to provide us with the correct line item 
data for all SKUs to be included in the orders.

### EU DDP 

We are able to offer DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) on both tracked and untracked orders to the
following EU countries: 

- Germany
- France
- The Republic of Ireland
- Portugal
- The Netherlands
- Cyprus 
- Malta
- Austria

We charge a flat **20% of declared value** to cover the import tax & duties of your zines, 
and our additional administration costs associated with doing so. 

Note that this is a **fixed** fee and doesn't vary based on local taxes or the goods 
you're sending. This allows you to charge your backers a single percentage of tax for the 
regions we support DDP to. 

_**What is DDP?**_

Usually we deliver items without customs charges or duty paid. The recipient receives notification
from the postal service and pays the levied charges and an administration fee. With DDP, we pay
any charges on your behalf before the border so your zines are delivered quicker, more reliably 
and without the recipient having to take any action.

## Storage 2023

Storage is chargeable monthly per SKU per box (minimum 1 SKU per box), above 1 free box.

A box is a standard 29.5 x 23 x 19cm (these are fairly close to the boxes printers ship in).

| # of additional boxes | Monthly cost |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| 1                     | £10/month    |
| 2                     | £15/month    |
| 3                     | £17.5/month  |
| 4                     | £20/month    |
| 5                     | £22/month    |

## Distribution 2023

Distribution is in addition to storage, and is charged per 30kg box shipped within the UK. 

| # of Boxes | Cost |
| ---------- | ---- |
| 1          | £15  |
| 2          | £25  |
| 3          | £35  |
| 4          | £40  |
| 5          | £45  |

International distribution (including customs cleared in the EU) is possible, but quoted for 
individually to give you the most accurate and up to date cost. 

## Bundling and Assembly

We don't routinely do assembly, however we do consider requests to help people out. 

Assembly is taking multiple items (eg. multiple zines, player sheets, stickers etc.) and 
combining them into a single pack to be sold as a combined SKU. 

Please [contact us](mailto:fulfilment@peregrinecoast.press) if you think you might need this!
