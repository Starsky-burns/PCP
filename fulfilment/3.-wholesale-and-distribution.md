# ðŸ—„ 3. Wholesale & Distribution

Weâ€™ll hold stock on your behalf from your printers, and ship it out to stores on demand. Quick, easy and painless for you!

### ðŸ¤” How it works

1. We agree in advance the SKUs that weâ€™ll hold on your behalf
2. You send us the inventory which weâ€™ll store on your behalf - make sure you keep your own inventory tracking so you donâ€™t oversell!
3. Youâ€™ll ping us an email when you need to send out some stock and weâ€™ll let you know the pricing options
4. Weâ€™ll get it sent out and let you know the tracking
