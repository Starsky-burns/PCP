# 👋 Getting Started

Welcome to our public fulfilment guide! This is designed to serve as a reference for how we do fulfilment at Peregrine Coast Press, what you can expect from us and what we expect from you 🙂

{% hint style="info" %}
These docs are a work in progress! Please let us know any comments or feedback so we can expand and improve them 😊
{% endhint %}

We’re always super excited when people reach out to us to arrange fulfilment, and we’ll do our best to help out!

As a quick guide, here are the things we’re good at:

[✅ Bulk fulfilment for Kickstarters or crowdfunding](../crowdfunder-distribution.md)

:hourglass\_flowing\_sand: On-demand fulfilment to customers (ie. dropshipping) - _we're talking a pause on this right now_

✅ Receiving, itemising and storing stock from printers

[✅ Distribution and shipping wholesale orders to other shops](../wholesale-and-distribution.md)

✅ Export, including handling customs into the EU

[✅ Consolidation and forwarding](../consolidation-and-forwarding.md)

✅ Pallet handling & freight

Some of the things we’re not really set up for just yet:

❌ Complex assembly (eg. folding, gluing, cutting etc.)

❌ Long term storage (we don’t have space!)

We try to be flexible, so if there’s something you’re looking for help with then let us know and we can see if it’s something that is feasible!

Once you’re looking to get started, send us an email over to [fulfilment@peregrinecoast.press](mailto:fulfilment@peregrinecoast.press) with more details about you need to ship (volume, dimensions, weight) and we’ll get the ball rolling.

Check out the rest of the articles to get an idea of what that will look like 🙂
