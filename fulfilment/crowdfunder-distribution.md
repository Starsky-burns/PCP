# ðŸ¥³ Crowdfunder Distribution

### ðŸ¤” How it works

1. You run your crowdfunding campaign and get a load of awesome backers!
2. Let us know the SKUs that weâ€™ll ship (check out [Goods-In Procedures](goods-in-procedures.md)), particulaly if you have complicated tiers
3. Once backers have submitted their addresses, you send us the shipping data (check out [Goods Outbound](goods-outbound.md)) and we'll send them an invoice to pay their exact shipping fee
4. You send us the stock to fulfil directly from your printer
5. We ship it out :tada:

### Charging backers for shipping

This is something new we're offering :raised\_hands:&#x20;

Instead of you collecting shipping fees with shipping addresses, we take your order data and use it to calculate the most accurate shipping fees for the backer to pay.&#x20;

We'll email them an invoice (via Stripe) which they can settle up with us securly and directly.&#x20;

This has a few advantages:&#x20;

1. You don't need to set up shipping rates or worry fiddly weight bands. Our [current pricing](pricing-and-invoicing.md) can be used as a guide on your crowdfunding page if you'd like.&#x20;
2. Backers are charged exactly the right amount close to when their item ships. You won't be exposed to fluctuations in the price of shipping, de-risking your campaign&#x20;
3. _Coming Soon: we're aiming to collect EU taxes, avoiding unexpected and expensive administration fees for backers_
