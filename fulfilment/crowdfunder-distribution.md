# ðŸ¥³ Crowdfunder Distribution

### ðŸ¤” How it works

1. You run your crowdfunding campaign and get a load of awesome backers!
2. Let us know the SKUs that weâ€™ll ship (check out [Goods-In Procedures](goods-in-procedures.md)), particularly if you have complicated tiers
3. Once backers have submitted their addresses, you send us the shipping data (check out [Goods Outbound](goods-outbound.md)) and we'll send them an invoice to pay their exact shipping fee
4. You send us the stock to fulfil directly from your printer
5. We ship it out :tada:
