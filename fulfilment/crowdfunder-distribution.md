# 🥳 Crowdfunder Distribution

### 🤔 How it works

1. You run your crowdfunding campaign and get a load of awesome backers!
2. Let us know the SKUs that we’ll ship (check out [Goods-In Procedures](goods-in-procedures.md)), particulaly if you have complicated tiers
3. Once backers have submitted their addresses, you send us the shipping data (check out [Goods Outbound](goods-outbound.md)) and we'll send them an invoice to pay their exact shipping fee
4. You send us the stock to fulfil directly from your printer
5. We ship it out :tada:

### Charging backers for shipping

This is something new we're offering :raised\_hands:&#x20;

Instead of you collecting shipping fees with shipping addresses, we take your order data and use it to calculate the most accurate shipping fees for the backer to pay.&#x20;

We'll email them an invoice (via Stripe) which they can settle up with us securely and directly.&#x20;

This has a few advantages:&#x20;

1. You don't need to set up shipping rates or worry fiddly weight bands. Our [current pricing](pricing-and-invoicing.md) can be used as a guide on your crowdfunding page if you'd like.&#x20;
2. Backers are charged exactly the right amount close to when their item ships. You won't be exposed to fluctuations in the price of shipping, de-risking your campaign&#x20;
3. _Coming Soon: we're aiming to collect EU taxes, avoiding unexpected and expensive administration fees for backers_

We charge backers a flat rate 75p service charge to cover the incidental costs we incur - time, invoicing software, data transformation etc.&#x20;
