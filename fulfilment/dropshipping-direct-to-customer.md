# ðŸ“® Dropshipping - direct to customer

You run your store, we handle the packing and shipping for you! ðŸ’¯

### ðŸ¤” How it works

1. We agree in advance the SKUs that weâ€™ll hold on your behalf, and how those are to be fulfilled
2. You send us the inventory which weâ€™ll store on your behalf - make sure you keep your own inventory tracking so you donâ€™t oversell!
3. Youâ€™ll send us a weekly file that meets our specifications and weâ€™ll use that to ship your items - easy!
4. If youâ€™ve asked for it, weâ€™ll send you shipping data with tracking numbers by return
