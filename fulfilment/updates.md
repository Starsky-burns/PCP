# ℹ️ Updates

We'll keep this set of documentation updated. You can see changes [here](https://github.com/Starsky-burns/PCP/commits/main).

If we're updating something that materially affects the terms on which we do business with customers, then we'll publish a blog with explanatory information (on our [homepage](https://www.peregrinecoast.press/)). Please subscribe to our newsletter to get these updates.&#x20;

This documentation, in particular the pricing, **does not** constitute a contractual agreement. If you require contractually binding pricing for a period of time you must contact us via email.&#x20;

These docs may change at any time at our sole discretion. Any changes are binding from the date they are published.&#x20;
