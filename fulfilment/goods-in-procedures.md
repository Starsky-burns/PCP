# ‚û°Ô∏è Goods-in Procedures

As you might expect, we get a lot of mail and it‚Äôs important that we keep track of exactly what is coming and going! We‚Äôll try to keep this as lightweight and flexible as possible - we know you can‚Äôt always control how packages are sent to us.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You must have an agreement with us (via email) to hold a particular SKU before it is shipped to us. We're super flexible about this but **please don't** send us anything without prior agreement!
{% endhint %}

### :handshake: Confirming SKUs

Let us know once you've confirmed the SKUs you'll be sending us. This doesn't have to be before your campaign ends, but we do need to know the details before you ship anything to us :eyes:

Take a copy and fill out [this template,](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1frxtOoDdv53twMpfie8S0xzA\_1ahj9otB-q3BiUgf6o/edit) then share it back to us via Google Drive.&#x20;

We'll get the SKUs configured on our end and make sure all the customs data is set up properly.&#x20;



### üìÑ Pre-Advice

Once your stock starts shipping to us, fill out our pre-advice form:

[Pre-Advice - Peregrine Coast Press Fulfilment](https://forms.gle/5be6mSikB23xuqw46)

You will receive email confirmation and be able to edit your pre-advice if you make a mistake.

**Note:** shipments that are received without a corresponding pre-advice will be chargeable, and may be rejected.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Checking

When we receive your shipment, we‚Äôll let you know and confirm we have received it in good order and we believe it to be complete.

If we need to count or inventory your items because it‚Äôs unclear what we have been sent, this will be chargeable per SKU in the shipment.
